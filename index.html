  <h1>1989</h1>

  <p>Taylor Alison Swift (born December 13, 1989) is an American singer-songwriter. Raised in Wyomissing, Pennsylvania,
    she moved to Nashville, Tennessee, at the age of 14 to pursue a career in country music. She signed with the
    independent label Big Machine Records and became the youngest songwriter ever signed by the Sony/ATV Music
    publishing house. The release of Swift's eponymous debut album in 2006 marked the start of her career as a country
    music singer. Her third single, "Our Song", made her the youngest person to single-handedly write and perform a
    number-one song on the Hot Country Songs chart.

    Swift's second album, Fearless, was released in 2008. Buoyed by the pop crossover success of the singles "Love
    Story" and "You Belong with Me", Fearless became the best-selling album of 2009 in the United States. The album won
    four Grammy Awards, with Swift becoming the youngest ever Album of the Year winner. Swift's third and fourth albums,
    2010's Speak Now and 2012's Red, both sold more than one million copies within the first week of their U.S release.
    Speak Now's "Mean" won two Grammy Awards, while Red's singles "We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together" and "I Knew
    You Were Trouble" were successful worldwide. Swift's fifth album, the pop-focused 1989, was released in 2014 and
    sold more copies in its opening week than any album in the previous 12 years, making Swift the first and only act to
    have three albums sell more than one million copies in the opening release week. Its singles "Shake It Off", "Blank
    Space", and "Bad Blood" reached number one on the Billboard Hot 100. The album won three Grammy Awards, with Swift
    becoming the fifth and only female act to receive the Album of the Year award twice.</p>
